		After retrieving the desired metadata associated with the video file, we are now ready to

		at a time from the video stream using the vid_capture.read() method
		vid_capture.read() returns a tuple, first element is boolean, and the next element is the actual time frame
		When the first element is true, it indicates that the video stream contains a frame to read.

		If there is a frame to read, you can then use imshow() to display the current frame in a window, otherwise
		exit the loop. Notice that you also use the waitkey() function to pause for 20ms between video frames.
		Calling the waitkey() function lets you monitor the keyboard for user input. In this case, for example, if
		the user presses the 'q' key, you exit the loop.
